# Reminder: try to keep everything as dynamic as possible for content pack based devleopment and scripting interface(much easier/faster to parse a string into map calls than into field reads).

//TODO Entity-Component-System Framework
  //TODO - write tests for ecs framework
//TODO MsgPack/nano networking for multiplayer?
//TODO runtime/metrics interface
